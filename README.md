# Moving-through-Space-GUI-Version
This program implements a  GUI version of “Moving through Space” Adventure Game.

In my initial game version based on the command line (https://github.com/BoHu-sussex/Moving-through-Space-Adventure-Game), there are many parts like entering a room,
fighting with a monster, choosing a reward, and choosing next room. To make these game parts
easier to understand and more convenient to play, this project provides a GUI version.

## How to run my game
My game needs you have installed `PIL` package because the GUI version needs to process images.

You can install `PIL` package via `pip install Pillow`.

Run the `GameGUI.py` to begin the game.
